Incredibly clear messaging
String diffing in reports
Discourage Sharing / Encourage Isolation
Simple API that does one thing... IE, assertEqual only runs !==
assertions map to language
single TestCase class
high performance (cpp future?)
Error report only up to the assertion error but not beneath it - users should not be witness to unittest code
easily configurable
no dependencies
